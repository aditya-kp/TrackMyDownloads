>TagComboBox in the searcg GUI now populates tags from the database when the searchGUI is created. 
>Listeners added to the searchField, runButton, openLocationButton and searchButton

//Note : does the populator add a file that was already added if we select it again ??

To Do

1. Add a delete file button which will delete entry from file and tagged_to tables 
2. Add Button in the searcg gui to add files 
3. Make the UI unified ... They look like they are whole different programs
4.
